    <h4>How we got started</h4>
    <h5>After graduating high school, I realized that making friends as a neurodivergent was more difficult. During my time in college, I was inspired too bring my friends together, creating this social group. My goal is to help other neurodivergent individuals find and create friendships.</h5>
